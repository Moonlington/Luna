A simple bot for Discord.

## What does Luna offer?
* Memes
* Games (just 1)
* Tag system
* Music
* Fun and stuff

## How do I add Luna?
Just click this beautiful link: **https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=170405995049254913&scope=bot&permissions=-1**

## If i want to run her myself, how do i do that?
First make a file called `credentials.json`, where you enter your bot account's client_id and token. It should look like this.

```JSON
{
    "token": "your bot token",
    "client_id": "your client_id",
}
```

After this you edit `cogs/utils/checks.py` with **YOUR** ID.

## Stuff you need
A lot of stuff. I really need to shorten it or make a list.
